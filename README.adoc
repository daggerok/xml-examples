== DTD/XSD

link:./dtd/[DTD (document type definition]

pros:

- program can assume structure and don't need do a lot of validations
- XSL (extensible stylesheet language) takes XML and processed it to needed format
- specification / API
- describe data and how it's looks like

cons:

- not so flexible
- DTD can be really messy
- XSD can be much more (really) messy

TODO: add similar examples for XSD, XPath, XQuery and XSLT
